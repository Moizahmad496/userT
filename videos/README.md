## How to Add Your Videos

Place your video files in this folder with the following names:

- `memory1.mp4` - First memory video
- `memory2.mp4` - Second memory video
- `memory3.mp4` - Third memory video
- `memory4.mp4` - Fourth memory video

## Video Requirements

- **Format**: MP4 (recommended for best browser compatibility)
- **Recommended Size**: Keep videos under 10MB each for faster loading
- **Orientation**: Any orientation works, but videos will be cropped to fit a 250px height
- **Duration**: Keep videos short (5-30 seconds) for best experience

## Alternative Formats

If you have videos in other formats (MOV, AVI, etc.), you can convert them to MP4 using:
- Online converters like CloudConvert
- VLC Media Player
- HandBrake (free)

## Tips

- Use vertical or square videos for best display on mobile
- The videos will loop automatically
- Videos are muted by default but viewers can unmute them
- Keep file sizes reasonable for smooth playback
